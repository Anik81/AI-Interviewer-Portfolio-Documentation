## 💬 Common Questions

### Q: Can I share this publicly without company approval?
**A**: Always get written approval first. Use the documentation as a starting point for discussion with your manager/HR.

### Q: What if I can't take screenshots of the production system?
**A**: Use a local development environment with demo data, or create mockups/wireframes using Figma.

### Q: How detailed should I be about proprietary features?
**A**: Focus on architecture patterns, technology choices, and general approaches—not specific business logic or algorithms.

### Q: Should I include code samples?
**A**: Generic code patterns (like repository pattern examples) are fine. Never share actual production code without approval.

### Q: What if competitors might see this?
**A**: That's why we focus on technical skills demonstrated, not business secrets. The documentation shows your capabilities, not your company's competitive advantages.
